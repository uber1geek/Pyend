# Pyend
Pyend is a simple commenting system build on Python Flask. 


I decided to name this WIP project, Pyend which is a Kashmiri word for a shop front, that is where most typical and sterotypical discussions take place.

The topics mostly discussed on shop porches -- typically known as 'pyend' in Kashmir-- are Kashmir uprising, oppression, cricket, and recent robbery of seven lakh rupees worth of gold ornaments belonging to a would-be bride in the locality.
