# Pyend
Pyend is a simple commenting system built on Python Flask. 


I decided to name this WIP project "Pyend" which is a Kashmiri word for a shop front and that is where most typical and sterotypical discussions take place.

The topics mostly discussed on these shop porches are Kashmir uprising, oppression, cricket, and recent robbery of seven lakh rupees worth of gold ornaments belonging to a would-be bride in the locality.
